# Podcast Listening Time Prediction

This project focuses on predicting podcast listening times using a regression model. The goal was to predict how much time users would spend listening to a podcast based on various features of the podcast episodes. The model achieved an **85% accuracy** on validation data and was further optimized using **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning, improving performance by **15%**.

## Key Highlights

- **Prediction Model**: Developed a regression model that predicts podcast listening times with **85% accuracy** on validation data.
- **Model Optimization**: Optimized machine learning algorithms through **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning, improving model performance by **15%**.
- **Large Dataset**: Analyzed a large-scale podcast dataset containing **100,000+ episodes** to extract meaningful features for prediction.
- **Kaggle Collaboration**: Collaborated with a global data science community on **Kaggle**, ranking in the **top 10%** of participants for model accuracy.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Kaggle**: Participated in the Kaggle competition for collaborative learning and model validation.
