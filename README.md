# Podcast Listening Time Prediction

This project focuses on predicting podcast listening times using a regression model. The goal was to predict how much time users would spend listening to a podcast based on various features of the podcast episodes. The model achieved an **85% accuracy** on validation data and was further optimized using **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning, improving performance by **15%**.

## Key Highlights

- **Prediction Model**: Developed a regression model that predicts podcast listening times with **85% accuracy** on validation data.
- **Model Optimization**: Optimized machine learning algorithms through **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning, improving model performance by **15%**.
- **Large Dataset**: Analyzed a large-scale podcast dataset containing **100,000+ episodes** to extract meaningful features for prediction.
- **Kaggle Collaboration**: Collaborated with a global data science community on **Kaggle**, ranking in the **top 10%** of participants for model accuracy.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Kaggle**: Participated in the Kaggle competition for collaborative learning and model validation.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/podcast-listening-time-prediction.git
cd podcast-listening-time-prediction
```

Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the validation set.

Performance Improvement: Improved the model by 15% using hyperparameter tuning via grid search.

Data Insights: Extracted key features like episode length, user engagement metrics, and podcast category to improve model performance.

Kaggle Competition
As part of the global collaboration, the project was shared and competed in a Kaggle competition. The model ranked in the top 10% based on its accuracy, allowing for valuable community feedback and further optimizations.
